# Stroke Prediction Service
The prupose of this project is to provide a stroke prediction service, which could be used by GPs, doctors and health providers to understand the risk of stroke. By picking early indication of risk, health service providers can provide intervention and help patients
understand the risk. They can further work with the patients to design a plan or provide a prescription to reduce the risk of stroke

The service will be provided as an API, and the IT teams can use it and integrate it as a service
